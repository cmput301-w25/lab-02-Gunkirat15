## Lab Feedback

- Good work on the lab!
- Please make sure to put your Android Studio code in a seperate `code` folder in the repo in the future.
- Also, although your method for city deletion works, please make sure you have seen the `onItemClickListener()` method, as that will be an important function for you to know for your project.
